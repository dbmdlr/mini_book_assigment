# mini_book_assignment
Mini book project developed with Java, JSP and servlets.
Database used was MySQL. The project contains a file named OracleConnection.java, because initially Oracle was going to be the DBMS for the project, but we had the opportunitty to choose wich one to use and everything was replaced with MySQL syntaxis.
